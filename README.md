**Introduction**
Welcome to Fruit Catcher! Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our game.

**Data Collection**
Fruit Catcher only stores your score and highscore locally on your device. We do not collect, store, or share any personal or sensitive data from our users. Your gameplay activity, scores, and any other interactions within the app are not tracked or recorded beyond your local storage.

Fruit Catcher uses Google AdMob to serve ads. Google AdMob may collect and use certain data as described in their privacy policy. This includes, but is not limited to, device information and advertising data. For more information on how Google AdMob handles your data, please refer to Google AdMob's Privacy Policy.

**Permissions**
Fruit Catcher does not require any special permissions that would allow us to access your personal information or device data.

**Third-Party Services** 
Aside from Google AdMob for advertising purposes, Fruit Catcher does not use any other third-party services that may collect information.

**Children's Information**
Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using the internet. We encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity. Fruit Catcher does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. If you think that your child provided this kind of information on our website, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately and we will do our best efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.
